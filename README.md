# Recap Week 2

Use the files in each task's corresponding folder to complete the following activities.

**Remember to break down each task, make a plan before you code, and commit often using meaningful commit messages!**

Note: You can [click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZtNGUhP50j8S2Qn1i0VwlHlfYH0QpIs5iVYyGKnl3LU/edit?usp=sharing) to view the videos made by your fellow bootcampers this week as well!

## Task 1

👉 Write a function called `makeLegend`, which takes in a `name` (string) as its only argument. The function should return a new string which includes the name plus the words `' is now a legend.'`.

- For example, if the function was called with the name `'Chris'`, it should return the string `'Chris is now a legend.'`.

👉 Using the `makeLegend` function, the `celebs` array and a `for` loop, create a new array which includes `' is now a legend.'` for each celebrity. Save this new array to the variable `legendaryCelebs`.

- For example, if the `celebs` array was `["Chris", "Liz", "Alice"]` to begin with, then `legendaryCelebs` would contain `["Chris is now a legend.", "Liz is now a legend.", "Alice is now a legend."]`

👉 Use another for loop to produce a new array of all of the celebrity names which start with a vowel, and store that new array in a new variable called `vowelCelebs`.

- For example, if the `celebs` array was `["Chris", "Liz", "Alice"]` to begin with, then `vowelCelebs` should contain `["Alice"]` (as Alice is the only name that begins with a vowel).

## Task 2

👉 In the task-2 `index.html`, there is a `p` tag (with an id of `count`) that displays a count. Ensure the count displays 0 when the page loads and then, using `setInterval`, have it increment by 1 every second.

👉 Stop the above interval from incrementing after 12 seconds have passed using the [clearInterval](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_clearinterval.asp) function. So 12 should be the last count displayed on the page.

## Task 3

For this task, you'll be using the [Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) to get image URLs.

👉 Using `fetch`, get a random cat image URL using the API URL: https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search

👉 Once you have retrieved your image URL, display the image on the page using the `img` element provided (with id of `cat-here`). A different picture should be displayed every time you reload the page.

👉 Using JavaScript, create a button element and add it to the page. Add an event listener to the button so that, when you click the button, a new image is displayed.

## ⭐ Bonus

Use the task-4 folder for these.

👉 On your HTML page, you will see an input field and an 'Add To List' button. Declare a new variable, `importantThings`, as an empty array. Using JavaScript, configure the website so that when you write something in the input field and click the `Add To List` button, a new item is added to the `importantThings` array.

👉 As well as adding the item to the in-memory array, now display each added item in an `li` element within the ordered list.

👉 Add a new label and input field element to your `index.html` file. This input field represents the priority value of your important thing, and should take in a number. Refactor your code so that, when you click your `Add To List` button, you add an object to your array, rather than a string value. For example: `let importantThings = [{text: 'telephone mother', priority: 1}]`.

👉 Add a new button to your site called `Order List`. When the button is clicked, reorder your list by priority.

## ⭐ Bonus Bonus

🎉 For the `makeLegend` function from Task 1, **refactor** it to check that you were handed a string - if you weren't, then return `'A legend requires a string'`

## ⭐ Bonus Bonus Bonus

🎉 Style your pages with CSS!

## Hints

### Task 2

Think about using document.querySelector to access the p tag. How would you track the seconds?

### Task 3

Remember fetch returns you a promise. You always await a promise. To use await, you must be in an async function.

You can set the [src attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_clearinterval.asp) of the `img` just like you would set the `textContent` of a `p` element

You already have a function which grabs new images and updates the image shown on the page. Link this to the button through addEventListener
