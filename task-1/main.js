/*
## Task 1

👉 Use an array method to produce a new array of all of the bootcampers names which start with `'r'` and store in a new variable.

👉 Write a function called `makeLegend`, which takes in a `name` (string) as its only argument. The function should return a new string which includes the name plus the words `'is now a legend.'`. For example, if the name given was `'Chris'`, the function would return the string `'Chris is now a legend.'`.

👉 Using an array method and the `makeLegend` function, create a new array which includes `'[name] is now a legend'` for each item. Save assign this new array to the variable `legendaryBootcampers`.
